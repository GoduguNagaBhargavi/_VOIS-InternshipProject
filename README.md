# Project Description: 
Steganography is the art and science of concealing information within digital media such as images, audio files, or videos, without visibly altering the original content. In this digital age, with the rise of data privacy concerns and the need for secure communication channels, steganography plays a crucial role in ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.

# Objective: 
The objective of this project is to develop an efficient steganographic system that can embed secret data within digital images while maintaining the integrity and imperceptibility of the original image.
